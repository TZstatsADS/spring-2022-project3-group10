+ Project summary: In this project, we created model1 and model2 in two methods to develop an image classification algorithm using images from CIFAR10 and improves the accuracy comparing to the baseline logistic regression model. In our main method, we bulit a CNN model, which significantly improves prediction accuracy comparing to the baseline model. After adding the label correction, the performance of CNN model was promoted to some extent. As for VGG model, it also improves the prediction accuracy a lot but the label correction has little influence on it.
	
**Contribution statement**: ([default](doc/a_note_on_contributions.md)) All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. 
+ All team members participated in group discussion and brainstorming session. Ke Liu, Shiqi Tang, Yvonne Zha and Haozhong Zheng mainly focus on constructing and tuning CNN models and Yvonne's model was selected to be the main model. Rong Xu developed VGG model which was chosen to be the optional model due to its performance.
	+  Ke writed the project summary and notes on github, integrated codes and files to upload, used gpu to run the code when testing model.
	+  Shiqi made the slides of our presentation, communicated with team members to confirm details.
	+  Yvonne built the CNN model and improved the model with label correction, proposed the method of splitting train set, validation set and test set to avoid overfitting. Also she organized the material of presentation and presented the results to the class.
	+  Rong built the VGG model with label correction to generate clean labels,analyzed the outcome of the model, and finished literature review to support our conclusion.
	+  Haozhong is responsible of running the code, making use of gpu to improve efficiency, setting the environment and adding cross-validation to CNN model to make the results more robust. 
+ All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement. 

**Instruction on using GPU Device**:
+ Run the code on device with Nvidia Cuda supported GPU device, the list of devices can be found at [CUDA GPUS](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus)
+ Install latest version of [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/zh-hans/)
+ Install [Nvidia Cuda Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) version 11.5
+ Install [Nvidia cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) version 8.3.2
+ Install tensorflow

**Potential bugs**:
+ No GPU device detected: If after running the first block, it is said that "No GPU device found", the rest of the code will run on CPU.
+ Out of GPU memories: We suggest run one of the VGG or CNN at a time. Since the training data set is large, the GPU may out of memories and cause errors
